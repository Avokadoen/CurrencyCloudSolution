# What is it?
This is example of the deployable solution that gathers currency data from https://fixer.io/ each day and save it in a custom Golang DB. You can then request convertion of any currency to any other currency through a webhooked bot in slacks. The bot also uses google diaglogflow to handle chatting with users. This code was also made to run within a docker container. 

# How to build
I used jetbrain's Goland to build this project but should build like any other golang application on ubuntu. I didn't make any documentation for this project and it's over 8 months since i actually made this so i don't recall the whole process sadly.

# Who to contact
akselhj@stud.ntnu.no
