# What is it?
This is example of the deployable solution that gathers currency data from https://fixer.io/ each day and save it in a custom Golang DB. You can then request convertion of EURO to any other currency. 

# How to build
I used jetbrain's Goland to build this project but should build like any other golang application on ubuntu 
("go install https://github.com/Avokadoen/CurrencyCloudSolution/").
